# Smurfs Images in Illustrator


Develped in: 2010

One of my first projects with Illustrator and Flash. We where given a Kinder Surprise and we had to develop an idea based on the gift inside.
Mine was the Painter Smurf.

These are some illustrator images i created for a flash game developed in the 2nd semester of my first year NMCT.
I can't find the source code of the flash game anymore unfortunately since it seems I lost the backup of everything created in the first year of college...

To create JPG from AI you can use the following. You will need imagemagick for this (graphicsmagick doesn't seem to support AI filesyet)
convert ai:*.ai -set filename:base "%[base]"  -density 1000 "%[filename:base].jpg"
