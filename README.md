# Smurfs Images in Illustrator


Develped in: 2010

One of my first projects with Illustrator and Flash. We where given a Kinder Surprise and we had to develop an idea based on the gift inside.
Mine was the Painter Smurf.

These are some illustrator images i created for a flash game developed in the 2nd semester of my first year NMCT.
I can't find the source code of the flash game anymore unfortunately since it seems I lost the backup of everything created in the first year of college...
